Accessibility Block for Moodle

Provides options for changing text size and colour scheme. Settings can be saved to persist between sessions. Colour settings can
be defined at the block instance level (Block instance configuration).

To install, place all files in /blocks/accessibility/ directory and visit /admin/index.php in your browser. To achieve block
appearance throughout entire Moodle site (so-called "Sticky block") once the plugin is installed into Moodle,
it's recommended to add its instance onto the Moodle homepage (/index.php). Homepage instance of the block enables "Page contexts"
option in block instance configuration to be set to "Display throughout entire site".

This block has been modified from the original for The Electrical Training Company Ltd. (ETCO) to remove unused features and add Bionic Reading API support https://bionicreading.com.
